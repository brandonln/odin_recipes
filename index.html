		It seems as though the world is collectively turning both
		its eyes and hearts towards the situation of Palestians in
		Gaza. While malnourishment is plauging
		such a large proportion of the population, we are reminded
		that God upholds the cause of the oppressed and marginalised.
	</p>
	<p>
		God is just, none can escape his pure, righteous judgement.
		In 
		Jesus Christ we have an advocate, such that through faith
		in Him and His resurrection, we may be holy and blameless
		in His sight. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Let us thank God for the gifts he has given us, for he is 
		most merciful and his gifts are plentiful. One of them is 
		food. We recieve this gift with thanksgiving, and take this
		oppurtunity to explore and celebrate the culture of the 
		Palestinian people, whom God created. We trust in the mercy
		and goodness of God during these dark hours. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		   Amen.
