The goal of this project is to create a basic website using HTML that
displays a selection of recipes I would like to try when I get back 
to Australia. 

The skills I aim to cultivate through this project are:
	- Atomic git commits 
	- Git commits that follow best practices (refer to 7 tips...)
	- Improved fluency with basic HTML tages (lists, images etc)

A side effect of this project is that it marks the first "project"
that I am working on since deciding to persue a career in CS. This 
is no small feat! It is worth celebrating, and thanking God for his
faithfulness in giving me the willingness to work for a good cause.
It can be good to remember why it is that I'm doing what I'm doing,
and if it's no longer clear why, or the reasons have changed, then 
it is ok to change course. But as it stands, it is important to me
that I can provide for myself, my family and those in need.

Alongside this, I may discover some interesting recipes to cook!!~
